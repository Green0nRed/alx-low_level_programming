- 0x14. C - Bit manipulation files :


- The file 0-binary_to_uint.c:Containa C function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int the parameter b is a pointer to a string of 0 and 1 characters if b=(NULL) or there are one or more characters in b that are not 0 or 1 - returns 0 or then returns the converted number.

- The file 1-print_binary.c:Contain a C function that prints the binary representation of a number.

- The file 2-get_bit.c:Contain a  C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index indices to start at 0 if an error occurs it returns -1 but in otherwise it returns the value of the bit at the given index.

- The file 3-set_bit.c:Contain C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1 But If an error occurs - returns -1 if not then - returns 1.

- The file 4-clear_bit.c:Contain C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0 but If an error occurs - returns -1 and if ther is no error it  returns 1.

-  The file 5-flip_bits.c:Contain a C function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another.

- The file 100-get_endianness.c:Contain a C function that checks the endianness if big then the returns is 0 if little it returns 1.
